## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Child divs tend to overflow and will require their overflow to be hidden in order to edit their border.



### Continued development

Shortly i will be adding more complex work including some JS.
